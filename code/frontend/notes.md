## How to pick ingredients

1. Show selects for each tag, so I can say "I want something that's sour". Downside: Given that items can have multiple tags, I find it distracting and confusing that they can pop up in tags selects I didn't click on.
2. Show selected ingredients on the top. Then we just need ways to remove and add.
   1. To remove, just click on it.
   2. To add, I need a search component. What does it include?
      1. Select tags to restrict (by default, show all)
      2. Enter a word to find matches
